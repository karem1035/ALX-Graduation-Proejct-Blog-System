## Django Blog Application

This is a full-featured blog application built using Python and Django, with MySQL as the database. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, manage user authentication, and includes a robust admin interface. The project was developed as part of my graduation from a Software Engineering Bootcamp.
